#### The purpose

This app is for users to gain knowledge on their expenses in contrast to their income, and see exactly which expenses are having the most or least influence on their balance.

#### Specifics

The app tells users which expenses weigh the most or least with the aid of calculations that turn income and expenses into a percentage of total income, and displays all the expenses with their income percentages.

here is an example of the program showing a positive balance with good percentages
